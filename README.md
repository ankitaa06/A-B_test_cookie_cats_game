# A-B_test_cookie_cats_game
Cookie Cats is mobile game which has over 1 million downloads on Google Play. Well the firm decided to tweak a bit in the game and move the paid version of new levels to gate 40 from gate 30 for some of the users. I am performing A/B testing here to compare the retention in two different types of user. The dataset is from two sets of users, one who encountered the locked level at level 30 and other at level 40.
